# DISCLAIMER
I do not claim responsibility for the creation of [Roundabout](https://github.com/Hydraheads/RoundaboutMod/), all credit for this wonderful mod goes to [Hydra](https://github.com/Hydraheads/).

# About The Project
[Roundabout](https://github.com/Hydraheads/RoundaboutMod/) is a mod that I love. It's fun, innovative, and has a nice community. However, as a previous developer of the mod, I'd like to see some changes to it that could not be implemented in the original version. This project serves to be a reimplementation of several of the systems to increase readability and compatibility.
